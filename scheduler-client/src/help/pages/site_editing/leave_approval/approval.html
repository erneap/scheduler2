  <h1>Leave Approval View</h1>
  <p class="role">(Site Scheduler/Leadership only)</p>
  <p>
    After a leave request is created and placed by the creator in the approval 
    cue, an email was sent to the site's approval authorities.  As an approver, 
    site leadership and scheduler, you open the Leave Approval view (shown below) 
    to review and possibly approve the requestor's leave.

    <ol class="level1">
      <li>CLick on the leave you want to review and possibly approve from the 
        list provided on the left side.  The selected leave will display in the 
        leave request editor (right side).
      </li>
      <li>
        You can make changes to their leave request, adjusting the overall 
        dates, and/or each day's leave code and hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        You also have two choices for leave approval/disapproval.  When you 
        approve a leave, 
        <ol class="level2">
          <li>
            <b>Approve Leave</b> - click the "Leave Approve" button and the leave is 
            set to a status of approved. All the request's leave days will added
            to the employee's leave list and an email will be sent to their 
            login email address telling them of the approval.
          </li>
