  <h1>Site Forecast Report Editing</h1>
  <p class="role">(Site Scheduler/Leadership only)</p>
  <p>
    The forecast report is a excel-based output that allows the site 
    leadership to track contract accomplishment.  Each contract for support 
    breaks up its accomplishment into periods of time with an allotted number 
    of hours per employee per function.  The contract probably lists a site 
    leader, an admin person, plus several other functional areas.  As an 
    example the site lead might be allocated 1860 hours for a period from 
    1 Oct to 30 Sep.  To define a forecast report, we need a name for it, the 
    report's period and the day of the week each weekly period ends.  Each 
    report's task list contains a series of charge number/extensions to define 
    the positions and hours for the period.

    <b>Example: </b> I'm going to use this example to explain the report and its 
    components.  The site consists of a site lead, 3 shift supervisors and 30 
    workers in 3 workcenters, each with 3 shifts.
