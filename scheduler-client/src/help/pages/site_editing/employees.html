  <p>
    The Employee Editor is the one-stop view for editing all things site 
    employees.  The display is broken down into the employee list with an “Add 
    New Employee” button and the selected employee’s editor views.  Many of 
    these views are the same as the employee sees, only the site 
    scheduler/leadership can select the employee to view, where the employee 
    only sees their information.
