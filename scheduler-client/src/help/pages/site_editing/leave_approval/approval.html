  <p>
    After a leave request is created and placed by the creator in the approval 
    cue, an email was sent to the site's approval authorities.  As an approver, 
    site leadership and scheduler, you open the Leave Approval view (shown below) 
    to review and possibly approve the requestor's leave.
