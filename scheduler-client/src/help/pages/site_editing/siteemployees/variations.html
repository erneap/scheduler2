        Select "New Assignment" in the "Select Assignment selector.  You will be
        presented with two fields below the selector, plus a single schedule to 
        use for the assignment with a period of 7 days.

        Select the variation's applicable period.  This requires at least two 
        clicks.  Use the calendar icon to the right of the field to select the 
        start date with the first click, then select the variation's ending 
        date.  The field will then display the start and end dates for the 
        variation.
      </li>
      <li>
        The next field is to designate the variation as being for a mid-shift 
        variation or not.  These are the two categories for a variation.
      </li>
      <li>
        The schedule is used to define how the variation is used against the 
        applicable assignment.  
        <ol class="level2">
          <li>Change the schedule period: Select the period days (7, 14, 21, or 
            28) to display.  If the start date doesn't begin on a Sunday, the 
            day in the schedule to be used is reference on the first Sunday 
            prior to the start date.  Adjust the shift to use, workcenter and 
            number of hours to use each day of the period.

              You are only required to set the days necessary but if the period 
              is longer that the number of day in the variation, you only have 
              to set the days of the period.

            for the day are blank.
