  <h1>Scheduler Overview</h1>
  <p>
    This web-based application was developed to ease the 
    burden on administrators in providing a comprehensive 
    team/site/employee schedule and produce the required 
    reports required by the various customers.  A team is 
    the overall group that is usually divided into sites 
    with a leadership element.  A site also has a small 
    leadership team and broken down into work centers where 
    most of the employees are assigned. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This tool will allow each user to see various aspects 
    of the application depending on their role within the 
    team and site.  The roles include:
    <ol class="level1">
      <li><b>Employee</b> – Everyone with a access account on 
      this application is initially an employee.  This is 
      the lowest common denominator and is given the least 
      privilege to updating necessary data.</li>
      <li><b>Site Scheduler</b> - The site leader will 
        select this individual who will be responsible 
        setting all site employee’s schedules and variations 
        (these terms explained later).  This person will 
        also prepare the site’s reports and email it out 
        to the various recipients.  They will also be able 
        to edit employee data to include their profiles, 
        change passwords, unlock accounts, edit company 
        information, assign primary labor codes, edit 
        approved leave, edit leave starting balances and 
        submit leave requests for the employee.</li>
      <li><b>Site Company Lead</b> – Since the team is 
        probably composed of a main company plus a portion 
        of the team composed of personnel from other 
        companies.  Work completed and leaves taken require 
        are included in the timecard ingest/manual entry 
        and this is the responsibility of the site’s 
        company leads.  They ensure their timecard system 
        data is ingested or manually entered, so this is the 
        area the site company lead has access to.</li>
      <li><b>Site Leader</b> – Site leadership isn’t just 
        the site lead, but also anyone assigned a leadership 
        position where assignment actions are decided, and 
        leaves approved.  A Site Leader has all the 
        permissions of the Site Scheduler plus leave 
        approval.</li>
      <li><b>Team Leader</b> – Team leadership are the 
        overall decision makers deciding on team composition 
        and contract maintenance.  Because of this, they 
        are granted the capability to add/edit/delete sites 
        and their employees.</li>
      <li><b>Application Admin</b> – This is the highest 
        role in the application and granted only to the 
        application administrator(s).  They have full 
        permissions to add/edit/delete teams plus purge old 
        data by date.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <h2>Terms</h2>
  <ol class="level1">
    <li><b>Assignment</b> – This refers to the normal work 
      schedule over a period of time.  All employees have 
      at least one assignment which also annotates when the 
      employee started working for the team/site and when 
      their last day of work was.  An assignment can have 
      multiple schedules.  If multiple schedules are to be 
      used and rotated through, the assignment can designate 
      a date to rotate upon and the number of days between 
      changes.  The selection of the assignment workday by 
      date is checking for a rotation period and date, 
      finding which schedule to use, then determine with 
      days within that schedule to provide.</li>
    <li><b>Schedule</b> – The schedule is defined as a 
      group of days (must be a multiple of 7) to be used to 
      define the workdays for the assignment.  All schedule 
      days start on a Sunday (first day of the week) and 
      include a multiple of 7 days.</li>
    <li><b>Workday</b> – A workday contains the work code for a particular day 
      numbered within the schedule, the work center assigned for that work and 
      the number of hours expected to be worked.  A blank workday includes a 
      blank code, a blank work center and zero hours.</li>
      
    <li><b>Variation</b> – A variation is defined as a temporary alteration in 
      the employee’s normal work schedule.  As an example:  The employee works 
      Tuesday through Saturday, 8 hours per day, working day shift in the GEOINT 
      work center, but you need them to work Mid Shift for 4 weeks.  You create 
      a variation with the scheduled start and end dates for the variation, 
      plus assign the variation’s schedule to the proper mid work code, work 
      center and number of hours.  If the site is using a mid-rotation, you 
      should set the IsMids flag of the variation to true.  A variation only 
      has one schedule and can be set to whatever multiple of 7-day period to 
      use.</li>
      
      <li><b>Leave</b> – A leave is any non-workday.  It could be vacation time, 
        a holiday, military or jury duty, or a few other options.  These are 
        started by completing a leave request and the individual’s supervisor 
        approving the leave.  All leaves include a leave code to show what type 
        of leave it is and the number of hours to be used.  The system 
        automatically adds a leave status (Actual, Approved, or Requested) to 
        show where the leave is in the process.
        <ol class="level2">
          <li><b>Actual Status</b> – This is normally determined by ingestion 
            of the timecard data or from the company lead’s timecard manual 
            input.</li>
          <li><b>Approved Status</b> – This signifies that the supervisor has 
            approved the leave request and will remain in this status until the 
            timecard data modifies the status that the leave was actual taken.</li>
          <li><b>Requested Status</b> – This signifies that the employee has 
            requested the leave, but the supervisor hasn’t approved it yet.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
