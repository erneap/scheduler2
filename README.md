# scheduler

The scheduler web application is made up of multiple components and was designed multiple sites, which contain multiple work centers or functional areas with employees working in each.: 
1. dataXFer application (GO) will be used to update the database with data from the old database using Excel files.
2. scheduler-api (GO) is the server interface for completing all CRUD operations for the application. 
3. authenication-api (GO) is my attempt to provide a central authentication mechanism for the RTX Osan's Scheduler and Metrics web applications.
4. scheduler-client (Transcript/Angular) is the front-end for the application for displaying schedule information, plus editing the database.

## Important Notes

### Encryption of Data at Rest
All data not necessary for immediate use will be encrypted while in storage, so
that only limited amounts of data would be available to a would be hacker.  Also,
no PII information is to be included in any database to preclude the possibility
of loss of this type of data.

### Work Hours Separation
Work hours based on manual input and/or timecard ingest will be separated from 
the employee record to allow for smaller employee records, containing only the
data necessary for transfer to web portal.  The work hours will be contained 
in annual work hour classes which will be encrypted and saved in the database
using a year/employee ID key.

## Database Structure

This program uses MongoDB to store all the information to be displayed.  This web application overall will access two of the three databases the RTX web applications use.  It will access Users database for authentication and scheduler database for data specific to scheduling the team.

## Data Modelling

The web application is written in GOLANG/GO for server-side portions of the application, namely the data transfer command line application, plus the two server APIs for data access.  Transcript/Angular data modelling will include interfaces for each class with a GOLANG structure to parallel the transcript class for ease of data transfer.

### User Class (Authentication)

The User class/structure/interface is used for authentication and passing the applications the logged in user's basic information and permissions.  It contains:

#### Properties
- ID - The key value for each user record using the UUID pattern (ObjectID)
